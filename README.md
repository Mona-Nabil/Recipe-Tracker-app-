# Recipe-Tracker-app

A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update or delete selected data. For this project, I built the interface of a food recipe CRUD app.

## Features
### Create new recipes -
RecipeCreate creates a form on screen for users to type in new recipes and submit them to the page to be displayed
stores its own state for form inputs

### Format new recipes -
-  RecipeFormat handles the input of a single recipe.
-  Adds a delete button to the recipe.
-  
### List all available recipes -
RecipeList renders full table display for all current recipes.

### App component -
-  our RecipeList table display, and the RecipeCreate form.
